Currently working on:

Generic repository?


GIT
---

Exclude EXE/DLL etc
Upload to github (hj/8b)





Something to think about
------------------------
An object model that represents the application
e.g. Main
		OpenWorkspaces
			Workspace
		RegisteredWorkspaces

inject reference to this into each workspace/class so accessible from anywhere?
or just a static Main....
have a look at cross-cutting concerns in DI book
